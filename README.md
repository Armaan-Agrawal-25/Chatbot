Chatbot: Designed and developed a “Chatbot” application that utilizes the Magpie library in Java to create a program that speaks to a user about basketball and the NBA. This was created as a way to express my passion for basketball and to provide people with a source of basketball knowledge.
- Wrote a Java program along with the Magpie library that allows a user to have a conversation about basketball and learn more about the NBA.
